      <h1>Chapters</h1>

      <p>
        Chapters are largely independent and can carry out their own projects â€“ these can be of a creative, educational, or entrepreneurial nature. They infuse our visioning process with a more regional perspective and open the debate to a far larger number of potential contributors. While discussions concentrate around people under 40, the intergenerational element of the process will be retained and (we hope) strengthened through the participation of numerous new experts in various fields from across the continent.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are currently three fully established Chapters (Austria, Belgium, Slovakia) and two Chapters in the early stages (Portugal and Scotland), looking for passionate and entrepreneurial 89ers. Being a Chapter Member enables you to actively contribute to our policy-making, organise events, and help bridge the gap between Brussels, the member states, and their citizens.
